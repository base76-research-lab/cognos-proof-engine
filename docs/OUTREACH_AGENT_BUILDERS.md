# Outreach Pack — Agent Builders

## Positioning
CognOS is a trust verification layer for AI API traffic.

Core line:
- "Add trust verification to AI API calls with minimal integration changes."

## Message 1 (LinkedIn DM)
Hi [Name] — we built CognOS, a trust verification layer for AI API traffic.
You can route a normal chat completion through CognOS and get decision/risk/trace_id for auditability.
Would you like a 10-minute alpha setup with a CLI + one example project?

## Message 2 (Email)
Subject: Alpha access — trust verification for AI API traffic

Hi [Name],
We are opening alpha access to CognOS.
It adds policy decisioning and traceability to standard AI API calls.

Fast path:
1) One request through CognOS
2) Get decision/risk + trace headers
3) Pull trace and generate trust report

If useful, I can share a quickstart and support first integration.

Best,
[Your name]

## Message 3 (X/short post)
Looking for 3 alpha builders to test CognOS:
A trust verification layer for AI API traffic.
- decision/risk per call
- trace_id for audits
- minimal integration surface
Reply "alpha" and I’ll send setup.

## Qualification Questions
- Are you currently shipping LLM features to users?
- Can you test one integration this week?
- Do you need auditability/compliance signals in logs?

## Conversion CTA
- "Send me your stack (Python/Node/agent framework) and I’ll provide a drop-in path."
